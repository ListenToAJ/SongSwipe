# SongSwipe :musical_note::beetle: 

SongSwipe will be a mobile web application that allows for a easier, quicker, and more user-friendly experience of cleaning out a Spotify playlist.

## Description

It allows for a simple Tinder-inspired swipe left-or-right motion  to decide whether a song will remain in your playlist or be removed.  Previews of the song will be played automatically.  Not only can a user easily remove unwanted old songs from their own playlists, but also filter out songs from a copy of another users playlist to make it more personal to the user.
